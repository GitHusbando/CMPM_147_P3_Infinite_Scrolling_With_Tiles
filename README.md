I tried to make infinite tidepools. At first I was trying to make the graphics look a little more realistic, but drawing with code is hard and I couldn't make anything that looked better than the geometric patterns, so I just went with it. Bezier curves and whatnot are available, but incredibly hard to work with by typing out lines of code. Drawing a star is also way too complicated :(. Overall though, I actually think what I wound up making is quite cute though. I also used noise to alter each tiles' brightness, which makes everything look way less flat.
